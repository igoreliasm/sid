The sid program reports the current sidereal time. It needs to know the
terrestrial longitude, which can be provided by a flag or by reading a file in
the format used by the Plan 9 astro command: one line of text containing the
latitude, west longitude, and elevation. (Only the longitude is used.)
With a flag, it will also display the Julian date.
